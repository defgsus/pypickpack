### In an amazon fulfillment center near you ...

your job application turns out to be against a bunch of newly designed super-efficient robots!

In an environment that slowly drives you mad with all it's technical difficulties on top of a super-compartmentalized,
competitive and unyielding hierarchy of snobbishness, exploited by the super-rich and kept in fuel by uncertainty 
and desires of super-utilized employees like yourself.

And rather join this super software project to help programing the machines for all the stupid jobs in the world.

Apart from conforming to the [The Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics), 
the robots should:

  - work **super-efficient**
  - work **better than their competitors**

Because, alas, they'll need to apply for jobs against other robots from different vendors, 
trying *to get the job done*, like you once did.

Using [Maximum Expected Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis) for the decision process, 
as described in [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russel & Norvig)](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), 
we might learn what it means if a machine tries to work *better* than everybody else. 
Don't forget! *You'll PAY to know what you REALLY think!*

**Preferences** of robots are encoded in the **utility function**, 
where differences might result in characteristics like:
 
  - *really hard working*
  - trying to make others look bad

And all that given the uncertainty of outcomes of actions in a cramped, dusty fulfillment stock where things lie
about everywhere, stock keeping units are printed too small and the stock keeper lusts for someone he can blame
for his recent mistakes.
